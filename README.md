This is a Next/Node project created for the MWI tech challenge.

The frontend of the project is completed in React/Next with the backend in Node. The app consists of two pages, an index page and a contact form page. The goal of these pages is to display text in boxes as well as static and show a calculated array when a link is clicked (index page) as well as a contact form that takes in information (contact form page). 

Utilizing React/Next was a new tool for me as I have never used either before, however I was able to find my way and complete the frontend challenge.

Backend is a skillset that I have not fully acquired yet but hope to do so soon. The backend challenge was a true test of all my skillsets and while the project does not work properly, I do feel that I have learned a lot and hope to learn more in the future in order to build something similar one day.

This challenge as a whole took one month to get as far as I could and was a true test of my skills. This challenge was exciting and a real learning process. I hope to continue to grow my skills and be able to build even better projects in the future.

To utilize this app:
Run using node commands (after cloning project):
  -Navigate to the server folder and run node server.js
  -Open second command line and navigate back to main folder and run npm run dev (build will fail)
  -Open http://localhost:3000 to view.
 *It's best to run the app without the backend in order to view the frontend because the backend does not work properly. 
 
 Thank you for your time and effort viewing my tech challenge project for MWI.
